    <title>Objective Theism</title>

<body>
    <h1>Now, a slightly harder question. Is this objective meaning deistic or panentheistic?</h1>
    <p>Info: Deism is the belief that God created the world and then stepped back, while pantheism is the belief that God is the world itself. </p>
    <p>Additionally, panentheism considers God and the world to be inter-related with the world being in God and God being in the world. </p>
